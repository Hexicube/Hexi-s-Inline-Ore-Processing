-- TIER 1 --
The basic yield improvement method. Easy to set up, reasonable gains, and low complexity.

Enrichment:
- 5x [X] Ore + 4 Seconds = 6x [X] Refined Ore

1.2x Yield

Ratio:
1 Enrichment
1.25ore/s -> 1.5ore/s
32 sets for blue belt input
80 sets for 3 blue belt output

Yellow belt processing:
11 Enrichment
~860kW



-- TIER 2 --
An extension to the basic method. Same concept, but you're dealing with a 4:3 ratio.

Crushing:
- 5x [X] Ore + 6 Seconds = 6x [X] Crushed Ore

Enrichment:
- 3x [X] Crushed Ore + 4 Seconds = 4x [X] Refined Ore

1.6x Yield

Ratio:
3 Crusher
4 Enrichment
2.5ore/s -> 4ore/s
16 sets for blue belt input
10 sets for blue belt output

Yellow belt processing:
17 Crusher
23 Enrichment
~3.6MW



-- TIER 3 --
Water is now a requirement.

Crushing:
- 5x [X] Ore + 5 Seconds = 6x [X] Crushed Ore

Cleaning:
- 3x [X] Crushed Ore + 1x Water + 2 Seconds = 3x [X] Clean Ore

Enrichment:
- 3x [X] Clean Ore + 4 Seconds = 5x [X] Refined Ore

2x/2.4x Yield

Ratio:
3 Crusher
2 Cleaner
4 Enrichment
2.5ore/s -> 5ore/s
16 sets for blue belt input
8 sets for blue belt output

Yellow belt processing:
17 Crusher
11 Cleaner
22 Enrichment
~7.8MW



-- TIER 4 --
Acid is now a requirement. Multiple fluids are now needed (including the ore itself), but this gives the absolute best yield.
Ratios are a bit nicer, however Crystallization only accepts 2 modules due to its size.

Crushing:
- 5x [X] Ore + 5 Seconds = 6x [X] Crushed Ore

Cleaning:
- 3x [X] Crushed Ore + 25x Water + 2 Seconds = 3x [X] Clean Ore
- 5x [X] Crushed Ore + 5x Light Oil + 7 Seconds = 6x [X] Clean Ore + 50% Stone + 5% Coal

Liquidation:
- 3x [X] Clean Ore + 0.1 Sulphuric Acid + 4 Second = 50x [X] Ore Slurry

Crystallization:
- 10x [X] Ore Slurry + 2 Seconds = 1x [X] Ore Crystal

Enrichment:
- 4x [X] Ore Crystal + 8 Seconds = 5x [X] Refined Ore

2.5x/3x Yield

Ratio:
3 Crusher
2 Cleaner
4 Liquidation
10 Crystallization (15 with all speed modules)

-- ADVANCED CLEANING --
Instead of using water to clean ore, light oil can be used with a better cleaning machine to increase yield by 20% for tiers 3 and 4.
The recipe is slow, it produces byproducts randomly, and uses more power and pollution.
The change in output also messes up ratios (4.8 liquidation + 12/18 crystal + 12 enrich / 4.8 enrich), to the point where using an imperfect ratio is preferable (4.8 becomes 5 instead of 5x the machines).

Advanced Cleaning:
- 5x [X] Crushed Ore + 5x Light Oil + 7 Seconds = 6x [X] Clean Ore + 50% Stone + 5% Coal

Whilst this would increase tier 3 to 2.4x Yield, it's far more efficient to jump to tier 4 for 2.5x Yield with less power draw and less oil usage and then use this on tier 4 for 3x Yield.
