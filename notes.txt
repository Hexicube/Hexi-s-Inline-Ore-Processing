-- TIER 1 --
The basic yield improvement method. Easy to set up, reasonable gains, and low complexity.

Enrichment:
- 5x [X] Ore + 5 Seconds = 6x [X] Refined Ore

1.2x Yield

1 Enrichment



-- TIER 2 --
An extension to the basic method. Same concept, but you're dealing with a 4:3 ratio.

Crushing:
- 5x [X] Ore + 7.5 Seconds = 6x [X] Crushed Ore

Enrichment:
- 3x [X] Crushed Ore + 5 Seconds = 4x [X] Refined Ore

1.6x Yield

3 Crusher + 4 Enrichment



-- TIER 3 --
Water is now a requirement.

Crushing:
- 5x [X] Ore + 7.5 Seconds = 6x [X] Crushed Ore

Cleaning:
- 3x [X] Crushed Ore + 1x Water + 1.25 Seconds = 3x [X] Clean Ore

Enrichment:
- 3x [X] Clean Ore + 5 Seconds = 5x [X] Refined Ore

2x Yield

3 Crusher + 1 Cleaner + 4 Enrichment



-- TIER 4 --
Acid is now a requirement. Multiple fluids are now needed (including the ore itself), but this gives the absolute best yield.
Ratios are a bit nicer, however Crystallization only accepts 2 modules due to its size.

Crushing:
- 5x [X] Ore + 7.5 Seconds = 6x [X] Crushed Ore

Cleaning:
- 3x [X] Crushed Ore + 1x Water + 1.25 Seconds = 3x [X] Clean Ore

Liquidation:
- 3x [X] Clean Ore + 0.1 Sulphuric Acid + 5 Second = 5x [X] Ore Slurry

Crystallization:
- 4x [X] Ore Slurry + 10 Seconds = 4x [X] Ore Crystal

Enrichment:
- 2x [X] Ore Crystal + 5 Seconds = 3x [X] Refined Ore

2.5x Yield

3 Crusher + 1 Cleaner + 4 Liquidation + 10 Crystallization (15 with all speed modules) + 10 Enrichment



-- ADVANCED CLEANING --
Instead of using water to clean ore, light oil can be used instead to increase yield by 20% for tiers 3 and 4.
This takes much longer to do (messing with ratios for those stages), and thereby massively increases power/space demands.
This also results in a byproduct, which can be directly converted into stone.

Advanced Cleaning:
- 5x [X] Crushed Ore + 0.25x Light Oil + 11.25 Seconds = 6x [X] Clean Ore + 1x Stone

Whilst this would increase tier 3 to 2.4x Yield, it's far more efficient to jump to tier 4 for 2.5x Yield with less power draw and less oil usage and then use this on tier 4 for 3x Yield.
